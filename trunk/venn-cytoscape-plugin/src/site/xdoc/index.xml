<section name="Summary">

<p>
dishevelled.org <b>venn-cytoscape-plugin</b> provides venn diagrams for
Cytoscape [<a href="#1">1</a>] as a plugin.  The venn diagram Cytoscape plugin
requires java version 1.6 or later and Cytoscape version 2.7.0 or later.
</p>
</section>

<section name="Venn Diagrams">
<p>
The plugin provides a diagram view and a details view for comparing two to four
Cytoscape groups at a time.
</p>

<p>
The diagram view is an interactive venn diagram showing the number of nodes in each
logical grouping.  Clicking on any area in the diagram selects the corresponding
nodes in the current Cytoscape network view.  The diagram can be exported to an
image file in PNG format.
</p>

<p>
The details view shows the nodes in each logical grouping.  The selection model
of the details view synchronizes the selection for all of the list views (i.e.
selecting a node in any one list will select it in all lists) and exports the
selection to the current Cytoscape network view (selecting a node in the details view
will select it in the current Cytoscape network view, but not vice versa).
</p>
