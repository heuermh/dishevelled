<section name="Summary">
<p>
dishevelled.org <b>iconbundle-tango</b> provides static icon bundles and icon sizes
for the Tango Project icon theme.  The iconbundle-tango project has dependencies
that require java version 1.4 or later.
</p>
</section>

<section name="Usage">

<p>
Static instances of <a href="http://www.dishevelled.org/iconbundle/apidocs/org/dishevelled/iconbundle/IconBundle.html">IconBundle</a>
are created by the
<a href="apidocs/org/dishevelled/iconbundle/tango/TangoProject.html">TangoProject</a> class:
</p>

<source>
IconBundle folder = TangoProject.FOLDER;
IconBundle multimediaPlayer = TangoProject.MULTIMEDIA_PLAYER;
IconBundle viewRefresh = TangoProject.VIEW_REFRESH;
</source>

<p>
All variants of this base image, for different text directions, sizes, and states,
are available from this icon bundle.  Tango Project icon theme icons are currently
only available in left-to-right orientation.  The default Tango Project icon sizes
(Extra Small, Small, and Large) are provided as static instances of
<a href="http://www.dishevelled.org/iconbundle/apidocs/org/dishevelled/iconbundle/IconSize.html">IconSize</a>
in the class <a href="apidocs/org/dishevelled/iconbundle/tango/TangoProject.html">TangoProject</a>.
An AWT or Swing component may be passed to the icon bundle to provide hints as to e.g.
selection colors for the image.
</p>

<source>
JComponent label = new JLabel();

// Large (48x48)
Image folderRtlNormalLarge = folder.getImage(label,
                                             IconTextDirection.RIGHT_TO_LEFT,
                                             IconState.NORMAL,
                                             TangoProject.LARGE);

// Small (22x22)
Image multimediaPlayerLtrSelectedSmall = multimediaPlayer.getImage(label,
                                                                   IconTextDirection.LEFT_TO_RIGHT,
                                                                   IconState.SELECTED,
                                                                   TangoProject.SMALL);

// Extra Small (16x16)
Image viewRefreshLtrMouseoverExtraSmall = viewRefresh.getImage(label,
                                                               IconTextDirection.LEFT_TO_RIGHT,
                                                               IconState.MOUSEOVER,
                                                               TangoProject.EXTRA_SMALL);
</source>

<p>
The icon bundle will load Extra Small and Small icons from 16x16 and 22x22 pixel .png files and will
load Large and any other size icons from scalable .svg files.  A jar artifact including these
Tango Project icons is available from the central maven repository and is used by this library.
