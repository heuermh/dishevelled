<p>
dishevelled.org <b>layout</b> provides layout manager(s) for
lightweight JFC/Swing components.  The only layout manager included
to date is LabelFieldLayout.
</p>
</section>

<section name="LabelFieldLayout">
<p>
LabelFieldLayout is a wrapper around GridBagLayout that simplifies things
for the common case of two columns, one of labels and one of fields.
</p>

<p>
A simple example:
<source>
JPanel panel = new JPanel();
LabelFieldLayout l = new LabelFieldLayout();
panel.setLayout(l);

panel.add(new JLabel("Label label:"), l.labelLabel());
panel.add(new JLabel("Label field"), l.labelField());

l.nextLine();
panel.add(new JLabel("Normal label:"), l.normalLabel());
panel.add(new JTextField("Normal field"), l.normalField());

l.nextLine();
panel.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(12), l.spacing());

l.nextLine();
panel.add(new JLabel("Wide label:"), l.wideLabel());

l.nextLine();
JList list = new JList(new Object[] { "Final wide field A",
                                      "Final wide field B",
                                      "Final wide field C" });
panel.add(new JScrollPane(list), l.finalWideField());
</source>
</p>

<p>
The final component in a LabelFieldLayout stretches vertically to cover
space left at the bottom of its container.  It can be either an empty
component, such as <code>Box.createGlue()</code>, a wide label, or a wide field,
such as a <code>JList</code> in a <code>JScrollPane</code>, as this image demonstrates:
