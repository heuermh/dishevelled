<section name="Summary">

<p>
Provides a simple timer class with nanosecond resolution and summary
statistics on recorded elapsed times.</p>

<p>
For example:
<source>
Timer t = new Timer();
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
  t.start();
  // ... the code being measured ...
  t.stop();
}

System.out.println("timer results, n=" + t.size());
System.out.println("  mean=" + t.mean() + " stdev=" + t.standardDeviation());
System.out.println("  min=" + t.min() + " max=" + t.max());
</source>
</p>

<p>
The recorded times themselves are not preserved, however, only
the summary statistics.  As a consequence <code>start()</code> and
<code>stop()</code> can be called many number of times without
requiring large amounts of memory.
