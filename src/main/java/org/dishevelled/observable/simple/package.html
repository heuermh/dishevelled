<p>Simple observable decorators for collection and map interfaces.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>
The decorators in this package simply fire empty vetoable change events in
<code>preXxx</code> methods and empty change events in <code>postXxx</code> methods.
Listeners may query the source of the events to determine what may or may
not have changed due to the event.
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>
For example, consider a listener interested in changes in size of an observable collection of strings:
<pre>
class SizeChangeListener&lt;String&gt;
  implements CollectionChangeListener&lt;String&gt;, VetoableCollectionChangeListener&lt;String&gt;
{
  private int sizeBefore;
  private int sizeAfter;

  public void collectionWillChange(final VetoableCollectionChangeEvent&lt;String&gt; event)
    throws CollectionChangeVetoException
  {
    ObservableCollection&lt;String&gt; source = event.getObservableCollection();
    sizeBefore = source.size();
  }

  public void collectionChanged(final CollectionChangeEvent&lt;String&gt; event)
  {
    ObservableCollection&lt;String&gt; source = event.getObservableCollection();
    sizeAfter = source.size();
    if (sizeAfter != sizeBefore)
    {
      // collection size changed, do something...
    }
  }
}
</pre>
</p>
  </body>
